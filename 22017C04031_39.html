	<article>Lorem ipsum is a type of dummy text that is used to fill the space where the real content should be. It is based on a piece of Latin literature from 45 BC, but it has been scrambled and modified over time. Lorem ipsum is useful for testing the layout and design of a website or a publication, without being distracted by the meaning of the text. It is the most common placeholder text in the printing and publishing industries.</article>
